2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTLP-1#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
1 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is clk_in. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: clock_OBUF_inst_i_2.
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
12 out of 13 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: TMR0[7:0], TMRIF, clk_ex, clock, sel_clk.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
12 out of 13 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: TMR0[7:0], TMRIF, clk_ex, clock, sel_clk.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clock_OBUF_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
TMR0_v_reg[0], TMR0_v_reg[1], TMR0_v_reg[2], TMR0_v_reg[3], TMR0_v_reg[4], TMR0_v_reg[5], TMR0_v_reg[6], TMR0_v_reg[7]
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port TMR0[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port TMR0[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#3 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port TMR0[2] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#4 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port TMR0[3] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#5 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port TMR0[4] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#6 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port TMR0[5] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#7 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port TMR0[6] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#8 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port TMR0[7] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#9 Warning
