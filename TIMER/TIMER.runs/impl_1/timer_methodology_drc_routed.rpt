2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin TMR0_v_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin TMR0_v_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin TMR0_v_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin TMR0_v_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin TMR0_v_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin TMR0_v_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin TMR0_v_reg[6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin TMR0_v_reg[7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell TMR0_v[7]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) TMR0_v_reg[0]/CLR, TMR0_v_reg[1]/CLR, TMR0_v_reg[2]/CLR, TMR0_v_reg[3]/CLR, TMR0_v_reg[4]/CLR, TMR0_v_reg[5]/CLR, TMR0_v_reg[6]/CLR, TMR0_v_reg[7]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch TMRIF_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin TMRIF_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#1 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between clock_OBUF_inst_i_2/I0 and clock_OBUF_inst_i_2/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>
